Smart-Music
===========

This is a project I started while compete for a 50k engineering grand prize. It was an interesting and education project and one I continue to work on. This project contains a USB MIDI device driver for Linux and Android;  A MIDI decoder, and MIDI playback via a connected USB MIDI device or to a UDP cleint (see the Java clients).

The original dream, and still is, behind this project can be summarized in a few words: "Hobby Smart Music tablet in development". It is a work in progress. Others seeking to understand USB device drivers, MIDI, or Client/Server will find the source codes here useful.
